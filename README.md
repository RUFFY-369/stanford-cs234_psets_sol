# Stanford-CS234:Reinforcement Learning
This repo consists of my solutions to coding problems of Stanford's CS234 (Winter 2019) problem sets.

http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/CS234Win2019/index.html

Many of the solutions are both as python scripts and jupyter notebooks.

The videos of the final result of assignment 2 & 3 for some environments are included in  **'assignment(number)/sol_assignment(number)/results'**.

### Here is one of the highlghts from the results of different coding problems: 
#### Implementation of 'Deepmind's DQN' on 'Atari'
