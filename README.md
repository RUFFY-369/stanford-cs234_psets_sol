# Stanford-CS234:Reinforcement Learning
This repo consists of my solutions of Stanford's CS234 (Winter 2019) problem sets.

http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/CS234Win2019/index.html

Many of the solutions are both as python scripts and jupyter notebooks.

The videos of the final result of assignment 2 & 3 for some environments are included in  **'sol_assignment(number)/results'**.
